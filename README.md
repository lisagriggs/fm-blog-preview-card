## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Visual Studio Code


### What I learned

Building up my HTML and CSS experience more with this project. Included the CSS within the HTML document so it's easier to viewability, instead of a styles.css file for this project. 

Learnt more about Semantic HTML as I would always use divs in the past because experience from other web designers. I also used IDs since this is a dedicated project, but if more cards were involved, then I would use Classes instead to target multiple elements.
